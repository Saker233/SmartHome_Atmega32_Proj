# SmartHome_Proj
I used 2 MCUs PIC18F4620 communicated by UART to control and monitor a smart home consissts of 4 Rooms, central A/C and a TV
The whole control process is by keypad and LCD
At the beginng the system asks the user to enter the password for accessing the system adminstration then after that the admin
can control everything inside the home only from the keypad
